                    i know you did your best and i'm sure you did great, bebe. i'm so proud of you!!! 
                    i know you're under a lot of pressure right now and may sakit ka pa :( 
                    it's okay if you're feeling down right now, mahal. let yourself feel what you need to. i'm always here for you, hal.
                    but as i always tell you: don't worry too much ah? 
                    not to be pessimistic (hindi mangyayari 'to), but if ever you don't pass, 
                    i just want you to know: it's okay. that doesn't mean you can't reach your dreams na. 
                    you're still young, you have time, and you can still pursue psychology in another school hehe.
                    don't let the expectations of others weigh you down too much -- they don't matter as much as you think ha?
                    i know your parents will be okay with whatever the result is, and i know they're proud of you no matter what.
                <br>PAPASA IKAW!!! ‚ú® MANIFESTINGGGG ü§ûüçÄ <br>
                    i can't give you real flowers yet, so here's this muna, bebe.
                    i love you mwaaa üòô <br> <br>
                    You're loved beyond words üíå <br>
                    From: your amry ‚ô° </p>
